meta-config
===========

A comparison of configuring the same system in several configuration management systems.
Currently includes (alphabetically):
* Chef
* Puppet
* Saltstack (salt)

Motivation
----------

I started writing server configurations in 2009, using [bcfg2](http://bcfg2.org/).  Since then, I have ended up in DevOps positions, configuring cloud servers using [salt](http://www.saltstack.com/community/).

People keep telling me Chef or Puppet or ... are better tools for what I'm trying to do.  I'm tired of not having an informed opinion, so I decided to use them all to build systems I might actually use.
