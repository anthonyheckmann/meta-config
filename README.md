Motivation
----------

I started writing server configurations in 2009, using [bcfg2](http://bcfg2.org/).  Since then, I have ended up in DevOps positions, configuring cloud servers using [salt](http://www.saltstack.com/community/).

People keep telling me [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/) or [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source) or what have you are better tools for what I'm trying to do.  I'm tired of not having an informed opinion, so I decided to use them all to build systems I might actually use.
